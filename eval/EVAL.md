# Evaluation Framework

Let it be known that there are no other tools that have the exact outputs I need to create an evaluation framework expecting perfect outputs. However, I will still come up with a way to assess whether or not my Deep Research agent is able to successfully output good research - not by assessing what **is** in the results, but by assessing what **isn't**. The evaluation framework will evolve as I go, since I will need to optimize every step, including each of their prompts, and as I develop, things are bound to change.
